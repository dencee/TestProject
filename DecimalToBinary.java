		//Converting a decimal number to binary is a little trickier.
		
		//EXAMPLE: Convert 43 to binary
		
		/*
		 * Step 1: Divide the number by 2.
		 * Step 2: Write down the remainder from the division.
		 *         For example, 5 / 2 => 2 remainder 1, so write a 1.
		 * Step 3: Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the number is 0.
		 *    Example, convert decimal 43 into binary:
		 *    43
		 *    43 / 2 = 21 remainder 1
		 *    21 / 2 = 10 remainder 1
		 *    10 / 2 = 5  remainder 0
		 *    5  / 2 = 2  remainder 1
		 *    2  / 2 = 1  remainder 0
		 *    1  / 2 = 0  remainder 1
		 *    0 reached, END
		 *    
		 *    Starting from the bottom, write the remainders from left to right.
		 *    1 0 1 0 1 1 = 43!
		 *
		 * Why this method works:
		 * ----------------------
		 * The division by 2 and round down is the same as a binary right shift by 1.
		 * For example, the number 7 in binary is 111b. If we shift all the bits once to the
		 * right the number is 11b, which is 3 (remember, there are no fractions for integers
		 * so it's not 11.1b. The rightmost binary 1 is discarded).
		 *
		 * Checking the remainder is the same as checking if the rightmost binary digit 
		 * was a 1 or a 0 after the right shift removed it from the binary number.
		 *
		 * As the decimal number is continually divided by 2 (binary right shifted), the
		 * number keeps getting smaller until it reaches 0 and all the binary digits are
		 * accounted for.
		 *

		 *        43        101011
		 *        21         10101 (notice the rightmost 1 is gone!)
		 *        10          1010
		 *         5           101
		 *         2            10
		 *         1             1
		 *         0             0
		 *
		 * Challenge:
		 * ----------
		 * What about negative decimal numbers? Does the same method work? Below is a
		 * method that converts a decimal integer to a String of binary digits. Enter
		 * a negative number and check if it matches your calculations.
